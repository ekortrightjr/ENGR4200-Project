- Assembled and tested MicroROS robot
  + Robot has ros2 / nav2 installed
  + Rpi5
  + ESP32-based controller board
  + 2DOF camera
  + ORBBEC MS200 ToF LiDAR

- Extracted urdf file for simulation with Gazebo

- Installed nav2 on laptop unbuntu to support simulation and prototyping

- Fixed nav2 issues dds

- Tested navigation through waypoints

- Navigation through poses was determined to be unstable and not unstable

- Installed the simple_commander API

- Added ROS extensions to VSC

- Installed tf-transformations and transforms3d (to convert Euler angle to quaternion)
sudo apt install ros-humble-tf-transformations

- Tested nav2 navigation with the simple commander Python API, getting feedback throughout the navigation, and getting results at the end
  + Important for monitoring the robot and determining whether it is navigating correctly
