- Assembled and tested MicroROS robot
  + Robot has ros2 / nav2 installed
  + Rpi5
  + ESP32-based controller board
  + 2DOF camera
  + ORBBEC MS200 ToF LiDAR

- Extracted urdf file for simulation with Gazebo

- Installed nav2 on laptop unbuntu to support simulation and prototyping

- Fixed nav2 issues dds

- Tested navigation through waypoints

- Navigation through poses was determined to be unstable and not unstable

- Installed the simple_commander API

- Added ROS extensions to VSC

- Installed tf-transformations and transforms3d (to convert Euler angle to quaternion)
sudo apt install ros-humble-tf-transformations

- Tested nav2 navigation with the simple commander Python API, getting feedback throughout the navigation, and getting results at the end
  + Important for monitoring the robot and determining whether it is navigating correctly

- Created robot_navigation package and a skeleton of the nav2_node that implements navigation

- Added skeletons for:
  + nav2 node which will wrap simple commander and implement high-level application behaviors such as "go back to base"
  + patrol node which implements routine patrol behavior and yields control to sub-behaviors such as obstacle avoidance or traffic signal obeying
  + obstacle avoidance node which subscribes to LiDAR (or the camera) to detect close obstacles and uses simple commander to implement obstacle avoidance logic
  + traffic light recognition which listens to the camera, processes its images, detects signals, and uses simple commander to obey them

- Working on building a physical world for the patrol vehicle
  + working on a Gazebo model for simulation

- Built a small physical world in my garage
  + Successfully built a map and saved it
  + Tested navigation with simple commander with physical robot
  
- Brainstormed stretch goals, including 
  + asynchronously pre-empting routine patrol behavior and directing the vehicle to assist at a specified location.
  + gracefully exiting patrol to go to charging station and recharging battery
  + kill switch activated by building or human
